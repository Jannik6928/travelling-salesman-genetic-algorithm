# travelling-salesman-genetic-algorithm

 A Genetic Algorithm approach to optimizing the travelling salesperson problem. It asks, "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" I found an approximate solution using GA - the screenshots below show how the path is optimized over time.
